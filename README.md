# README

A [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) webapp to crowdsource interactive prompts
with Large Language Models.  Interactions can be generated by:

1)  Selecting a template prompt and filling in the placeholders.  2)  (In
Progress) Selecting a previous prompt and editting it.

All prompt queries then generate 1 or more results which can be ranked or
selected.  We implicitly interpret selected outputs to be preferable to any
non-selected outputs.

The interactions are all logged.  We later filter the interactions and use the ratings to fine tune models using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
